A wordlist attack is a common method for cracking WiFi passwords. In this attack, the attacker uses a pre-computed list of potential passwords, 
called a wordlist, and tries each one until they find the correct password. Here are the steps for performing a wordlist attack:
Put your wireless interface into monitor mode using the airmon-ng command:

$ sudo airmon-ng start <interface>

Replace <interface> with the name of your wireless interface, such as wlan0.

Use the airodump-ng command to capture the WiFi traffic and save it to a file:

$ sudo airodump-ng -c <channel> --bssid <bssid> -w <output_file> <interface>

Replace <channel> with the channel of the WiFi network you want to target, <bssid> with the MAC address of the access point,
<output_file> with the name you want to give to the output file, and <interface> with the name of your wireless interface.
For example, to capture the traffic of a WiFi network on channel 6 with BSSID AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF and save it to a file named capture on interface wlan0, 
you would use the following command:

$ sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -w capture wlan0

Use the aireplay-ng command to send deauthentication packets to a connected client, in order to capture the 4-way handshake:

$ sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <access_point_mac> -c <client_mac> <interface>

Replace <access_point_mac> with the MAC address of the access point, <client_mac> with the MAC address of a connected client, and <interface> with the name of your wireless interface.

For example, to send 1 deauthentication packet to a client with MAC address 00:11:22:33:44:55 and an access point with MAC address AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF on interface wlan0, you would use the following command:

$ sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -c 00:11:22:33:44:55 wlan0

Use aircrack-ng to crack the captured 4-way handshake using a wordlist attack:

$ sudo aircrack-ng -w <wordlist_file> <capture_file>

Replace <wordlist_file> with the path to the wordlist you want to use and <capture_file> with the path to the file containing the captured traffic.

For example, to crack the captured traffic in the capture-01.cap file using a wordlist in the file wordlist.txt, you would use the following command:

$ sudo aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt capture-01.cap

Keep in mind that using a wordlist attack to crack a WiFi password can take a long time, depending on the complexity of the password and the size of the wordlist. Additionally, this attack can be illegal if used without proper authorization, and it can disrupt the normal operation of a wireless network. Therefore, it's important to use it only for legitimate purposes, such as testing the security of your own wireless network.
